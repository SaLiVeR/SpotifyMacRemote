Spotify Mac Remote is a plugin for Spotify that allows you to use your Mac’s IR remote control to Play, Pause and change tracks.

The next, play/pause and previous buttons work exactly as you’d expect, the volume buttons control the system volume and holding the menu button quits Spotify – in case you want to use the remote with other apps.

Please note that when there are updates for Spotify you may need to download a new version of the plugin.

To uninstall the plugin just quit Spotify and then open Finder and browse to Macintosh HD > Library > Application Support > SIMBL > Plugins and delete SpotifyRemote.bundle
